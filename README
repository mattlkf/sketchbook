My private Arduino sketchbook.

Complete with a Makefile modified from Edam's Makefile, that allows us to compile and upload Arduino code without having to touch the official Arduino IDE.

The goal is that one can download the Arduino software first, then clone this sketchbook and compile from within this sketchbook without having to edit the Arduino software.
