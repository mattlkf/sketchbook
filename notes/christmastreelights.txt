Took a OMRON 25XOC2 from the Roboclub shelf.
    It's rated at 240V 20A so it's definitely safe.
    The lights are 50Ohm, so won't draw more than 2.4A at 120VDC
    Even if it's 120Vrms, max should be 170V/50 = ~3.3A

    Coil resistance of relay = 28Ohms
    
    Will proceed to measure turn-on current
    Off->On at around 90mA
    On->Off at around, well, less than 35mA.
