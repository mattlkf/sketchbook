Return to the lab

Today I accomplished the following:

1) Confirmed that we are able to get GPS data from the Libelium module.
	Setup: s110 + FTDI (5V VCC, 3.3V data) + Libelium Module + Adapter Cable + GPS Antenna
2) Measured current consumption of Arduino Pro Mini from China with LED on
	3.05mA at 4.6V (terrible! they scammed me, the regulated VCC should be 3.3V!)

3) Set up my Arduino private repo
