Todo:

1) Edit arduino.mk so that it supports the adding of user-defined BOARDS without having to edit the boards.txt file in the arduino directory.

2) Edit arduino.mk to replace SERIALDEV with TTY - makes for easier typing (:

3) Edit arduino.mk so silence unnecessary output when it's building all those objects, especially the output from mkdir.
