This demonstrate the use of Narcoleptic in conjunction with I2C and Serial.

If you #define PRINT_TO_SERIAL, current draw during sleep is 0.35mA

Without PRINT_TO_SERIAL defined, current draw during sleep is.. also 0.35mA

Turns out that A4 and A5 were leaking current. Writing LOW to them during sleep solved it.
