Procedure for use:
1) Turn on supply to sensors (plug in the 9V supply)
2) Turn on the Arduino (plug in the USB cable from the Arduino to the logging PC). Then, on the logging PC, start the logging (e.g. "cat /dev/ttyUSB0 | tee logfile.txt").
    - This will cause calibration to begin. At time of writing total calib time is 5 seconds.
3) Plug in the Raspberry Pi.
